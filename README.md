# Virtual Pet Simulator

A Python-based virtual pet simulator that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The program allows you to create and interact with a virtual pet through various activities.

## Features

- Create a virtual pet with customizable name
- Monitor pet's status (hunger, energy, and happiness levels)
- Interact with your pet through:
  - Feeding (reduces hunger, increases happiness)
  - Playing (increases happiness, decreases energy)
  - Sleeping (restores energy)
  - Training (teach your pet new tricks)

## Implementation

The program consists of two main files:
- `pet.py`: Contains the `Pet` class with all pet-related functionality
- `main.py`: Demonstrates the usage of the Pet class with example interactions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

Run the program by executing:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program will demonstrate various interactions with the virtual pet, showing how different actions affect the pet's status and abilities.
